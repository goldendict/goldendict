///    they are clicked with middle button. There's also an added possibility to
///    get double-click events after the fact with the doubleClicked() signal.
/// 2. Manage our own QWebInspector instance. In order to show inspector correctly,
///    use triggerPageAction( QWebPage::InspectElement ) instead.
